# 📘 About Gittxt

Gittxt is an open-source tool built to bridge the gap between GitHub repositories and Large Language Models (LLMs). It streamlines the process of extracting, structuring, and preparing code and documentation for AI consumption.

## 🧑‍💻 Meet the Developer

Created by **Sandeep Paidipati**, an early adopter of AI and open-source tools.

> "As someone who started exploring LLMs the moment they became public in 2022, I quickly ran into a common bottleneck: getting code or documentation into the right format for different AI tools. Some LLMs prefer `.txt`, others `.json`, and some won't even accept `.md`. Sharing GitHub repos with an LLM often felt like a formatting nightmare.
>
> I realized that what I needed—and what many others probably needed—was a way to compile all the usable content from a GitHub repo into a clean, consistent format that any LLM could ingest.
>
> That's how Gittxt was born. A utility that started as a simple script and evolved into a full-featured tool to help developers, researchers, and AI tinkerers extract the right text, fast."

## ✨ Vision & Goals

Gittxt aims to become the go-to bridge between open-source code and LLMs:

- **LLM Compatibility First**: Tailor repository data for frictionless use with tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Ollama.
- **One File, Many Uses**: Compile all relevant content into `.txt`, `.json`, or `.md`—whichever works best with your AI tool.
- **Empower Developers**: Save hours of manual prep with automated filters, formatters, and bundlers.
- **Promote OSS & Reusability**: Make it easy to share GitHub projects with AI agents, even in low-resource or free-tier environments.

## 🚀 What Gittxt Does

- 🔍 **Scans GitHub or local repositories**
- 📁 **Filters and classifies files** (textual, non-textual, skipped)
- 🧠 **Prepares structured outputs** for LLM ingestion
- 💬 **Supports AI summaries & chat** with OpenAI/Ollama models
- 📦 **Bundles everything into a ZIP** for portability

Supports:
- CLI tools
- Plugins (FastAPI, Streamlit UI)
- Reverse engineering from `.txt`, `.json`, or `.md` reports
