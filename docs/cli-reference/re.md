# 🔁 `gittxt re` Command

The `re` (reverse) command reconstructs the original repository structure from a Gittxt output report. This is useful when you only have `.txt`, `.md`, or `.json` exports and need the original source code files.

---

## ✅ Syntax

```bash
gittxt re <report_file> [--output-dir <folder>]
```

---

## 📋 Description

- Accepts `.txt`, `.md`, or `.json` reports generated by Gittxt.
- Extracts all reconstructable files and places them into a structured ZIP archive.
- Supports reports created with `--lite`, `--no-tree`, or partial content.

---

## 📄 Input

Supported input formats:
- `.json` (recommended)
- `.txt`
- `.md`

Each must follow Gittxt's output structure.

---

## 📦 Output

Creates a ZIP archive containing the reconstructed project.

### Output Structure

The resulting ZIP includes:
- All reconstructed text files
- Folder structure based on available report data

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Warnings

- If the input report used `--no-tree`, the directory tree may be incomplete.
- If the report used `--lite`, asset metadata and some structure may be missing.
- File content must be intact in the report.

Warnings shown in CLI:

```text
⚠️ Note: This report did not include a directory tree. Reconstructed structure may be limited.
⚠️ Note: No non-textual assets were included in this report.
```

---

## 🧪 Example

```bash
gittxt re reports/project.json -o ./restored
```

Creates: `project_reconstructed_<timestamp>.zip` under the default or specified `--output-dir`.

---

## 🔍 What Gets Reconstructed

- Files listed in the report
- Full paths and folder structure
- Textual content only (no binary files)

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Prefer `.json` for best reconstruction.
- Validate output using the tree view or unzip locally.
