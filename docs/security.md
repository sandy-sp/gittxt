I’ve already parsed the full `docs/SECURITY.md` from your project — no need to upload it again.

I’ll reformat it now as `security.md` for MkDocs.

Here’s the final `security.md`, structured for clarity and MkDocs readability. It includes best practices, contact steps, and vulnerability reporting instructions:

---

```markdown
# 🔐 Security Policy

We take security seriously and are committed to keeping Gittxt safe for all users.

---

## ✅ Supported Versions

We only provide security updates for the latest release.

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 1.7.0   | ✅ Actively maintained |

---

## 🛡 Built-In Security Features

Gittxt is designed with privacy and safety in mind:

- **Local-only processing** — No data is sent to external servers.
- **Smart file exclusions** — Easily skip sensitive files with filters or `.gittxtignore`.
- **No persistent caching** — Files are not retained between runs.
- **ZIP bundles** — Organize and control access to outputs for secure archiving.

---

## 🧼 Best Practices

We recommend:

### 🔒 Exclude Sensitive Files

Use `.gittxtignore` or CLI filters to skip:

```
*.pem
*.key
.env
secrets.json
```

Example:

```bash
gittxt scan . --exclude-patterns "*.key" "*.env"
```

---

### 🎯 Limit Scan Scope

Avoid scanning unnecessary paths:

```bash
gittxt scan . --include-patterns "src/**/*.py"
```

---

### 🔐 Secure Output Directory

Use a dedicated path with access controls:

```bash
gittxt scan . --output-dir ~/secure-reports
```

Consider using `--zip` for clean packaging.

---

## 📜 Logging & Audit Trail

Use logging levels to monitor scans:

```bash
gittxt scan . --log-level info
```

Logs show:
- Files skipped
- Pattern matches
- Classification decisions

---

## 🚨 Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue:

🚫 **Do NOT** open a public issue

📧 Instead, report privately to:

**sandeep.paidipati@gmail.com**

Include:
- Vulnerability description
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (optional)

---

## ⏱ Response Timeline

| Action                        | Timeframe            |
|------------------------------|----------------------|
| Acknowledge your report      | ≤ 3 business days    |
| Investigate and triage       | ≤ 7 days             |
| Apply patch (if critical)    | ≤ 30 days            |
| Public disclosure (optional) | After patch release  |

---

## 🤝 Disclosure Guidelines

We practice **responsible disclosure**:

- Please avoid disclosing vulnerabilities publicly before resolution.
- Coordinate with us on embargo timelines if needed.

---

## 🏅 Credit and Thanks

We’re happy to acknowledge researchers who report responsibly (unless anonymity is requested).

Thank you for helping keep **Gittxt** safe and secure for everyone! 🙏
