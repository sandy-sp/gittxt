# 📘 Welcome to Gittxt Docs

Gittxt is a command-line tool and plugin framework that converts Git repositories into clean, structured, AI-ready datasets.

Whether you're analyzing open source code, building training corpora, or archiving structured knowledge — Gittxt helps you:
- Extract textual content from repos with filters and format options
- Bundle outputs into `.txt`, `.json`, `.md`, or `.zip`
- Preview directory trees, token counts, and non-textual assets
- Extend functionality with plugins like a FastAPI backend or Streamlit UI
